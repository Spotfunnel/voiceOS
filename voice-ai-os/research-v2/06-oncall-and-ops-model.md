# Research V2: Oncall and Ops Model

## Purpose
This file defines the structure for the V2 oncall and operations model. It scopes alerting, auto-remediation, and human intervention thresholds without specifying runbooks.

## Why This Matters for V1

## What Matters in Production (Facts Only)

## Common Failure Modes (Observed in Real Systems)

## Proven Patterns & Techniques

## Engineering Rules (Binding)

## Metrics & Signals to Track

## V1 Decisions / Constraints

## Open Questions / Risks
