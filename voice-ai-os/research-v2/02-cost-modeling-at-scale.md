# Research V2: Cost Modeling at Scale

## Purpose
This file sets the structure for modeling unit economics at V2 scale. It covers blended cost per minute, target margins at $599 plans, and provider pricing realities without asserting outcomes.

## Why This Matters for V1

## What Matters in Production (Facts Only)

## Common Failure Modes (Observed in Real Systems)

## Proven Patterns & Techniques

## Engineering Rules (Binding)

## Metrics & Signals to Track

## V1 Decisions / Constraints

## Open Questions / Risks
