# Research V2: Provider Saturation and Failover

## Purpose
This file provides the scaffolding for analyzing provider throttling and saturation at V2 scale. It frames concurrency ceilings and spillover strategies without selecting any failover design.

## Why This Matters for V1

## What Matters in Production (Facts Only)

## Common Failure Modes (Observed in Real Systems)

## Proven Patterns & Techniques

## Engineering Rules (Binding)

## Metrics & Signals to Track

## V1 Decisions / Constraints

## Open Questions / Risks
