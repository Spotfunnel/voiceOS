# Research V2: Capacity Planning

## Purpose
This file defines the scope and guardrails for capacity planning at V2 scale. It frames concurrency, peak load, burst traffic, headroom, and saturation points without prescribing solutions.

## Why This Matters for V1

## What Matters in Production (Facts Only)

## Common Failure Modes (Observed in Real Systems)

## Proven Patterns & Techniques

## Engineering Rules (Binding)

## Metrics & Signals to Track

## V1 Decisions / Constraints

## Open Questions / Risks
