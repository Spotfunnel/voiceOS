# Research V2: Multi-Tenant Runtime Isolation

## Purpose
This file establishes the structure for studying runtime isolation at V2 scale. It focuses on noisy neighbor prevention, blast-radius containment, and per-tenant isolation without prescribing mechanisms.

## Why This Matters for V1

## What Matters in Production (Facts Only)

## Common Failure Modes (Observed in Real Systems)

## Proven Patterns & Techniques

## Engineering Rules (Binding)

## Metrics & Signals to Track

## V1 Decisions / Constraints

## Open Questions / Risks
